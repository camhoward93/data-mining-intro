# data-mining-intro
 
This is a course project for an introductory data mining course.

The easiest way to see the project and the code is to view the Report.ipynb file.

It has already been ran and the outputs are shown, but if you want to run the code
yourself simply download the file and open it in your preferred way (I used Google
collab).

All of the txt, xls, and csv files are the reference files for the databases and
machine learning testing / training data.

The format data python files were the basis for taking the datasets and formatting
them into usable frames. The report details the rest of the code used to find patterns
within the data.
